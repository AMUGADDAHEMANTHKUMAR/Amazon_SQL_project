## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Amazon Primeâ€™s movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions.

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Dataset

Include details about the dataset used, such as:
- `amazon_prime_titles.csv` file *(update this with the actual file name if different)*
- Source of the data (e.g., Kaggle or any public repository)

## ðŸ“Š Business Problems & SQL Solutions

Below are 15 business questions addressed using SQL on the Amazon Prime Movies and TV Shows dataset.

---

### 1. ðŸ“Œ Count the number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM amazon
GROUP BY type;
```

### 2. ðŸ“Œ Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT type, rating
FROM (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*),
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS ranking
    FROM amazon
    GROUP BY 1, 2
) AS t1
WHERE ranking = 1;
```

3. ðŸ“Œ List all "Movies" released in 2018

```sql

SELECT * 
FROM amazon 
WHERE type = 'Movie'
  AND release_year = 2018;
```

4. ðŸ“Œ Top 5 countries with the most content on Amazon

```sql

SELECT 
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')) AS new_country,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content 
FROM amazon
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

5. ðŸ“Œ Identify the longest movie or TV show duration

```sql

SELECT * 
FROM amazon
WHERE type = 'Movie'
  AND duration = (SELECT MAX(duration) FROM amazon);
```

6. ðŸ“Œ Find content added in the last 5 years

```sql

SELECT * 
FROM amazon 
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month,dd,yyyy') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years';
```

7. ðŸ“Œ Find all the content by director "Mark"

```sql

SELECT * 
FROM amazon 
WHERE director ILIKE '%Mark%';
```

8. ðŸ“Œ List all TV shows with more than 2 seasons

```sql

SELECT * 
FROM amazon 
WHERE type = 'TV Show' 
  AND SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT >= 2;
```

9. ðŸ“Œ Count of content items in each genre

```sql

SELECT 
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ',')) AS genre,
    COUNT(*)
FROM amazon
GROUP BY 1;
```

10. ðŸ“Œ Top 5 years with highest average content released by India

```sql

SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month,dd,yyyy')) AS year,
    COUNT(*) AS yearly_content,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(*)::INT / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM amazon WHERE country = 'India')::INT * 100, 2
    ) AS avg_release_per_year
FROM amazon
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY 1;
```

11. ðŸ“Œ List two movies that are Documentaries

```sql

SELECT * 
FROM amazon 
WHERE listed_in ILIKE '%Documentary%'
LIMIT 2;
```

12. ðŸ“Œ Find all content without a director

```sql

SELECT * 
FROM amazon 
WHERE director IS NULL;
```

13. ðŸ“Œ Movies where Salman Khan appeared in the last 10 years

```sql

SELECT * 
FROM amazon
WHERE casts ILIKE '%Salman%' 
  AND release_year > EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 10;
```

14. ðŸ“Œ Top 10 actors in Indian-produced movies

```sql

SELECT 
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(casts, ',')) AS actors,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM amazon
WHERE casts ILIKE '%ind%'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
15. ðŸ“Œ Categorize content as "Good" or "Bad" based on keywords

```sql

WITH new_table AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' OR description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'Bad_Content'
            ELSE 'Good_Content'
        END AS category
    FROM amazon
)
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM new_table
GROUP BY 1;
```

## ðŸ“Œ Findings and Conclusion

<!-- Introduction for fresher-level context -->
As someone who recently started learning SQL and data analysis, I took on the task of exploring Amazon Prime's movie and TV show dataset to apply my skills in a practical way. Here are the key insights I discovered:

<!-- Content distribution summary -->
**Content Distribution**: The platform offers a wide variety of movies and TV shows. This helped me understand how content is distributed across different types and categories.

<!-- Rating pattern insight -->
**Common Ratings**: I found the most frequent content ratings, which gave me an idea about the general audience Amazon Prime targets.

<!-- Geographical trends from the data -->
**Geographical Insights**: By analyzing content by country, especially India, I learned how regional trends impact content availability and production.

<!-- Classification logic using keywords -->
**Content Categorization**: Using keywords like "kill" and "violence," I practiced classifying content into categories like "Good" or "Bad," which helped me understand basic sentiment-style analysis.
